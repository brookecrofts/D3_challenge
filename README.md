This plot lists the percentage of poverty in each state and correlates it to the percentage of obesity in that same state. Click above the State abbreviation in each bubble to see the actual percentages.

Poverty. The current poverty threshold based on the Federal government is $25,700/year for a family of four. The poverty rate in 2018 in the United States was 11.8%, roughly 38.1 million people. In order of ethnicity, Native Americans were at the highest (25.4%), with Black, Hispanic, White and Asian descending in percentage respectively.

Obesity. As of 2020, the United States obesity rate has topped 40%. Poverty decreases a person's opportunity for healthy food options and safe physical activity. The U.S. data has consistently shown that the more a person earns the less likely they are to be obese.
